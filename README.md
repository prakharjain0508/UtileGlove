# UtileGlove

Humans and machines do not interface well. In an attempt to bridge the gap between humans and the systems they interact with, a plethora of input methods have been devised: keyboards, mice, joysticks, game controllers, and touch screens are just a few examples. Unfortunately, none of these devices remove the barrier between man and machine. 

With the UtileGlove control system, we aim to remove this obstruction by allowing the user to control a hardware device using natural gestures. This system takes advantage of a multitude of sensors to capture hand movements and uses this information to control a device â€“ in this case, a bot car. Users will be able to wear the glove and control the bot with only a small amount of instruction. This is just a basic model and the same concept can be used to modify a wheelchair that can be controlled by the handicapped person using gestures.
